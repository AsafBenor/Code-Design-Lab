# Code-Design-Lab
Exercises on coding design fundamentals: Implemented advanced patterns and paradigms to build robust, efficient software applications in the "Code Design Lab" course.
Exercise 3: Composite and Iterator Patterns
Implemented the Composite pattern through classes representing a music playlist, where playlists can contain songs or other playlists, allowing recursive operations. Developed a PlaylistIterator utilizing the Iterator pattern for deep iteration over all song titles in a playlist.

Exercise 4: Builder Pattern
Designed a custom MyStringBuilder in Java, supporting chaining methods such as append, reverse, and apply, facilitating the manipulation of character sequences in a more memory-efficient and flexible manner than Java's standard StringBuilder.

Exercise 5: Interpreter Pattern
Created an interpreter for arithmetic expressions using a class hierarchy for different expression types. Utilized the Shunting-yard algorithm to convert infix expressions to postfix form, then evaluated them using constructed expression trees.

Exercise 6: Future and Observer Patterns with Active Object
Engineered an ObservableFuture class that extends Java's Future, notifying observers about the result readiness. Implemented an Active Object pattern, providing a thread-safe mechanism to queue tasks to be executed sequentially on a single worker thread.

Book Scrabble Game (Exercise 9)
Developed a game based on the mechanics of Scrabble but using words from a predefined book dictionary instead of a standard dictionary. The game features a multiplayer mode without a server, where players create intersecting words on a board, accumulating points based on letter rarity and special board tiles that modify scores.

Networked Game Setup (Exercise 10)
Set up a client-server model for the Book Scrabble game to support remote gameplay. Enhanced user interaction through network communication, allowing players to compete in real-time by connecting to a central server managing game sessions and player moves.

These descriptions succinctly cover the technical details and the scope of the projects, suitable for inclusion in a software development portfolio showcasing expertise in software design and pattern implementation.
